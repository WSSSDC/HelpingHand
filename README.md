# TBD

## 💡 Inspiration
We wanted to create a one-stop-shop for computer science students wanting to learn python, without having to sift through google, stackoverflow, and the documentation. While there are solutions like kite or GitHub Copilot, neither are available to ask questions such as: "What is a for loop?" or "How do I write an if statement?".

## 📱 What it does
TBD is an online IDE with 
## 🛠 How we built it
 - **React.js**: We used react.js to create the main site and 
 - **OpenAI's Codex & GPT-3**: We used these services for our interactive code generation and question answer features
 - **Flask**: We used Flask for the API server
 - **Repl.it**: We used Repl.it to host the python backend

## 🛑 Challenges we ran into
- Figuring out how to work with programs that require an input
- Creating our own bash shell

## ✅ Accomplishments that we're proud of
 - Writing a React.js site, we mostly make flutter apps and we wanted to try and change it up a bit
 - Creating our own python backend that executes the code, and returns the output
 - Creating our own API
 - Making our own file managing system

## 📖 What we learned
 - Mutlrithreading in python
 - Subprocesses in python
 - Postman
 - Using flask
 - Using React.js was a new experince for us
 - Lot's of linux

## 🤔 What's next for TBD
 - Add different themes
 - Integrate documentation for keywords in a tooltip
 - Implement user accounts to allow for online saving of projects
 - Monetize, Monetize, Monetize
